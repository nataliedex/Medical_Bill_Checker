        <h2>About This Tool</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> Hospitals are now required to publish detailed pricing information online for every medical procedure — a step toward transparency. However, these files are often massive, technical, and difficult for people to interpret.
            This tool makes hospital pricing accessible and understandable. It allows users to search by CPT codes, compare standard and negotiated charges, and filter by payer or plan type — all through a simple, interactive interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Data Source:</strong> All pricing data comes directly from publicly available hospital charge transparency datasets. While every effort is made to present accurate information, the displayed values are for informational purposes only and may not reflect real-time billing or out-of-pocket costs.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Intended Users:</strong> This application is designed for patients, families, and healthcare professionals who want a clearer picture of what medical procedures actually cost — without needing to download or parse massive datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Using the Data:</strong> Use this tool to explore general price ranges, compare procedure costs across hospitals, and understand how negotiated rates differ by payer. It’s a guide to make informed healthcare decisions — not a substitute for professional billing or insurance advice.
